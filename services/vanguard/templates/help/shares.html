<h1>Shares</h1>
<p>You can share data from any of your characters listed on the account page to any
    corporation or alliance using EVEData.org. For example if you wish to share with
    an alliance that your corporations structures are under attack, you can share
    notifications with them to notify when structures are attacked.</p>
<p>To start sharing data
    <ol>
        <li>Contact the alliance or corporation you wish to share with to verify they
            use our services.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="/U/eveAuth">Log into your account</a> with your main character. This is only for
            authentication, not data collection.</li>
        <li>Add characters that will share data
            <a href="/account">on the account page</a> with relevant scopes for the data to be shared</li>
        <li>
            <a href="/shares">Share data</a> from each character, to each entity.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Only characters you explicitly agree to share data will do so and is clearly marked
    <a href="/account">on the account page</a>. We will also send you a courtesy evemail if we see you
    change corporation to remind that you are sharing data provided you have no CSPA
    charge set.</p>
