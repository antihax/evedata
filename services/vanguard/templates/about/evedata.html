<h1>About EVEData.org</h1>
<p> EVEData.org has been operating since 2008, originally starting as a market and trade
    tool for the EVE Online in-game browser using basic HTML. Over time and with changes
    driven by CCP and other third party developers, the site has been refactored
    a number of times, but remains as a collection of tools that I use in-game for
    trade or PvP.</p>
<p> The site was originally written in utilizing Linux, Apache (mod_perl), MySQL, and
    Perl (LAMP). As the second Moondoggie was introduced to the EVE client, the website
    evolved to include more css formatted HTML and better tools with Javascript triggers
    to control the UI.</p>
<p> The latest version has been rewritten from the ground up using a micro-service infrastructure
    in Go, utilizing Percona Cluster, and Redis. Prometheus used to track backend
    metrics.</p>
